# Smart_Home_Project_Version_2 
A modified Version of Smart_Home_Project(https://github.com/OsamaMoussa/Smart_Home_Project.git), In this Version the Room Controller can send data back to the control room and can be shown on the Control room LCD. For Example the temperature sensed in room_1 can be shown on the LCDs of both the room and the control room.
Also The Fan's Motor in this Version is Controlled by Timer2, and the Door's Servo is controled by Timer1 (The motor and the servo in the previous Version were both controlled by Timer1 which caused some issues).
